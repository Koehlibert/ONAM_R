\title{Get variance decomposition of orthogonal neural additive model}
\usage{
decompose(object, data = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Either model of class \code{onam} as returned from \link{onam} or
model evaluation outcome as returned from \link{predict.onam}}

\item{data}{Data for which the model is to be evaluated. If \code{NULL}
(DEFAULT), the data from model fitting is used.
with which \code{model} was fitted.}
}
\value{
Returns a named vector of percentage of variance explained by each
interaction order.
}
