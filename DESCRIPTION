Description: An algorithm for fitting interpretable additive neural
    networks for identifiable and visualizable feature effects using post
    hoc orthogonalization. Fit custom neural networks intuitively using
    established 'R' 'formula' notation, including interaction effects of
    arbitrary order while preserving identifiability to enable a
    functional decomposition of the prediction function.
